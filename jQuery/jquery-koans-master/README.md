# jQuery Koans

This repository contains some exercises (koans) _to practice jquery concepts_. The purpose of the exercise is to get all tests passing by filling in the gaps in the code (test files)

This repository is based (forked) on [https://github.com/daveikaye/jquery-koans](https://github.com/daveikaye/jquery-koans)

## Working

To start working w/ the katas on the browser you can install the dependencies by doing

    npm install

And then launch the koans page in the browser by doing

    grunt serve

If you have the [livereload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei) plugin in the browser, every time you change a `.js` file, the page in the browser will be updated automatically.

So you can start filling in the gaps (in the `topics/*.js` files) to "solve" every test

## Solutions

My solutions are available on the `solutions` branch. To get this _version_ you must do

    git checkout solutions

You can also see all the tests passing at [http://juanmaguitar.github.io/jquery-koans/KoansRunner.html](http://juanmaguitar.github.io/jquery-koans/KoansRunner.html)
